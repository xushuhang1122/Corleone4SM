      "observation": "\n[GAME] Welcome to Secret Mafia! You are Player 3.\nYour role: Villager\nTeam: Village\nDescription: A regular villager. Your goal is to identify and eliminate all Mafia members through voting during the day.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nThe game progresses through Day and Night phases.\n- During the Day phase, there are 3 rounds of discussion followed by voting.\n- During discussions, everything you say is automatically broadcasted to all players.\n- After discussions, all players must vote to eliminate one player.\n- During the Night phase, you have no special actions.\n\nThe game ends when either all Mafia members are eliminated (Village wins) or\nMafia members equal or outnumber Villagers (Mafia wins).\n\n[GAME] Player 0 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 3] Player 0's death confirms the Mafia is among us. As a confirmed Villager, I urge everyone to share any observations or suspicions from last night—no detail is too small. Let's focus on logical discussion and avoid rushed accusations. Who has insights or noticed anything unusual? We need to work together to uncover the truth.\n[Player 5] I agree with Player 3's approach—we need to focus on evidence and logical discussion, not random accusations. Let's not rush to vote without solid reasoning, especially with so many unknowns. If anyone has suspicions, they should share concrete observations, not just target silent players without cause. We need to work together to find the real threats.\n[Player 1] I agree with Players 3 and 5—we need to focus on evidence and avoid rushing to vote without solid reasoning. Let's use the discussion rounds to share observations and look for inconsistencies in behavior. Anyone pushing for quick eliminations without proof should be viewed with suspicion, as that only helps the Mafia create chaos. Stay united and logical.\n[Player 4] I agree with the emphasis on careful discussion and evidence-based decisions. Let's all share our observations and reasoning openly, especially those who haven't spoken much. We need to avoid rushing to vote without solid information to prevent eliminating a Villager by mistake.\n[Player 2] I agree with Players 3 and 4—we need to focus on logical, evidence-based discussions and avoid jumping to conclusions. Let's not get distracted by emotional accusations; instead, we should analyze who is pushing for hasty votes without proof. That kind of behavior often comes from those trying to sow confusion. Let's stay calm and work together to find the real threats.\n[Player 3] Everyone, with Player 0 eliminated by Mafia last night, we know for sure there are threats among us. I urge you all to share any observations or anything unusual you might have noticed—no detail is too small. Let's focus on evidence and avoid rushing to vote without solid reasoning. We need to work together and stay vigilant to root out the Mafia.\n[Player 5] I agree with Player 3's approach—we need to focus on evidence and avoid rushing to vote without solid reasoning. Let's encourage everyone to share their thoughts openly and look for inconsistencies, but stay calm and logical. No one should be eliminated today unless we have clear grounds for suspicion.\n[Player 1] Let's all stay focused on sharing observations and reasoning logically. Rushing to vote without solid evidence only helps the Mafia. I agree with the emphasis on careful discussion—we need to work together to spot inconsistencies and avoid mislynches. Keep the conversation constructive and evidence-based.\n[Player 4] I appreciate the focus on careful discussion and evidence that Players 1, 3, and 5 have emphasized—it's crucial we avoid rushing to conclusions. Player 2, I encourage you to share your thoughts more openly; every perspective helps us piece things together. Let's all stay engaged and look for inconsistencies in what's said, rather than jumping to votes without solid reasoning. We need to work together to protect the Village and identify any threats logically.\n[Player 2] I agree with Player 3 and 4 that we need to focus on evidence and logical discussion before jumping to conclusions. Let's not rush votes based on emotions—we should analyze everyone's contributions carefully and look for inconsistencies or overly aggressive behavior that might indicate Mafia trying to cause chaos. Staying calm and methodical is our best shot at identifying the real threats.\n[Player 3] Player 0's elimination confirms Mafia is among us. Let's use this daytime to share observations—what stood out about Player 0's interactions or any night-phase hints? I urge everyone to prioritize logic and avoid hasty votes. We need transparency to catch inconsistencies. Player 2, I'd value your thoughts too; let's all contribute to uncover the truth.\n[Player 5] I agree with Player 3's approach—we need to focus on evidence and avoid rushing to vote. Let's encourage everyone to share their thoughts openly and look for inconsistencies, especially from those who haven't contributed much. Unity and careful discussion are key to finding the Mafia.\n[Player 1] I agree with the emphasis on evidence and careful discussion before we vote. Everyone should share their observations, especially those who've been quiet—like Player 2—so we can gather more clues. Rushing to vote without solid reasoning only helps the Mafia create chaos. Let's stay united and focus on logical analysis to identify suspicious behavior.\n[Player 4] Let's focus on gathering more information before jumping to conclusions. I encourage everyone, especially Player 2, to share any observations or suspicions they might have—every detail could be valuable. We need to work together and base our decisions on evidence, not guesswork, to avoid eliminating innocent players. If anyone has concrete reasons to suspect someone, please explain your reasoning clearly so we can all evaluate it. Unity and careful discussion are key to winning this.\n[Player 2] I agree with Players 3 and 4—we need to focus on evidence and logical discussion, not rushed votes. Let's avoid emotional decisions and watch for anyone pushing chaos or aggression, which could be a Mafia tactic.

        "strategy": "Reinforce my role as a trusted Villager by acknowledging Player 0's death as confirmation of Mafia presence and urging all players to share specific observations from the night phase. Use open-ended questions like, \"What did everyone make of Player 0 being targeted? Any subtle clues in pre-night interactions?\" to gather insights without accusing. Emphasize the importance of logical discussion over rushed votes, aligning with Players 1, 4, and 5 to maintain unity. Monitor Player 2 closely for increased engagement or defensive behavior, and be prepared to gently question inconsistencies if they arise. Avoid role claims or aggressive moves; instead, foster a transparent environment where Mafia might slip up. If voting occurs later, base my decision on accumulated evidence and behavioral patterns, prioritizing the elimination of players who deviate from collaborative norms.",
