State: \"Player 0, your sudden push to vote out Player 3 without evidence is alarming—it mirrors classic Mafia tactics to sow chaos and mislynch villagers. If you have concrete reasons, share them now; otherwise, your behavior is highly suspicious. I align with Players 1, 3, and 5: we must base votes on logic and evidence, not rash accusations.\"\n   - Reinforce unity by supporting the cautious, evidence-based approach of Players 1, 3, and 5, encouraging the group to analyze Player 2's elimination for clues (e.g., why Mafia targeted them) rather than rushing to vote.\n   - Keep my Doctor role hidden to avoid Mafia targeting. Tonight, protect myself unless a clear detective claim emerges (none so far), but remain flexible based on voting outcomes—if Player 0 is eliminated and confirmed Mafia, consider protecting a suspected villager like Player 3 or Player 1 next night.\n   - During voting, advocate against eliminating Player 3 and suggest voting for Player 0 if they fail to justify their aggression, leveraging the village's tendency to rally against suspicious behavior (as seen in past experiences).\n   - Monitor for any role claims or inconsistencies; if Player 0 deflects or becomes more aggressive, highlight this as further evidence of Mafia behavior.",

I suggest we discuss calmly and look for solid reasons before making a decision.\n[Player 3] I agree with Players 1 and 4—we need to focus on evidence and avoid rash accusations like Player 0's baseless claim against me. Jumping to conclusions without proof only helps the Mafia sow chaos. Let's stick to logical discussion and vote carefully.\n[Player 4] Player 0, your sudden push to vote out Player 3 without any evidence is alarming—it mirrors classic Mafia tactics to sow chaos and mislynch villagers. If you have concrete reasons, share them now; otherwise, your behavior is highly suspicious. I align with Players 1, 3, and 5: we must base our votes on logic and evidence, not rash accusations. Let's analyze why Player 2 was eliminated last night instead of rushing to vote—unity and careful discussion are key to exposing the Mafia.\n[Player 1] Player 0, your aggressive and baseless accusation against Player 3 raises serious red flags. You've provided no evidence and seem intent on sowing chaos rather than helping the village. We need unity and logic, not rash claims. If you can't justify your accusation, I urge everyone to consider voting against Player 0—this behavior mirrors past Mafia tactics. Let's focus on working together with Players 3, 4, and 5 to find real evidence and protect our village.\n[Player 0] I've been analyzing the discussions carefully, and Player 3's behavior raises serious red flags—deflecting suspicion and promoting inaction while others get eliminated. Player 2's death shows Mafia is targeting proactive voices, and we can't afford to stay silent. I urge everyone to vote for Player 3 today; it's our best move to protect the village. Let's stick to logic and patterns, not personal grudges.\n[Player 5] I agree with Players 1 and 4—we need to focus on evidence and avoid jumping to conclusions. Player 0’s aggressive accusations without proof are concerning and could be a tactic to create chaos. Let’s stay calm, discuss logically, and not let emotions lead us to eliminate the wrong person.\n[Player 3] I agree with Players 1 and 4 that we need to focus on evidence and avoid rushing to conclusions. Player 0's accusations seem baseless and are creating unnecessary chaos. We should be careful not to let emotional claims lead us into a mislynch. Let's discuss calmly and look for solid reasoning before voting.\n[Player 4] Player 0, your push to vote out Player 3 without any evidence is extremely concerning—it feels like a classic Mafia move to create confusion and mislynch a villager. If you have solid reasons, share them now; otherwise, this looks highly suspicious. I agree with Players 1, 3, and 5: we need to focus on logic and evidence, not rushed accusations.

You are Player 4.\nYour role: Doctor\nTeam: Village\nDescription: Protect one player each night from Mafia elimination.\n\nPlayers: Player 0, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5\n\nDuring DAY phase: Speak freely and vote.\nDuring NIGHT phase: '[Player X]' to protect a player.\nWin by identifying and eliminating all Mafia members.\n\n[GAME] Night phase - choose one player to protect: [0], [1], [2], [3], [5]\n[Player 4] [4]\n[GAME] Player 2 was killed during the night.\n[GAME] Day breaks. Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 1] Let's all take a moment to consider Player 2's elimination—killed by Mafia last night. I want to hear from everyone: what do you think this tells us? Who might have wanted them gone, or was it just a random target? Please share your thoughts openly, and let's focus on observations rather than jumping to conclusions. We need to work together and pay attention to how people contribute—or don't—in this discussion.\n[Player 0] Everyone, let's focus on the facts we have. Player 2 was eliminated by Mafia, which suggests they were seen as a threat or a vocal contributor. We should all share our thoughts on this and look for inconsistencies in behavior. I've noticed some defensive or evasive comments that raise red flags, and I urge everyone to vote carefully based on evidence and reasoning, not random accusations. Let's work together to identify and eliminate the Mafia.\n[Player 5] I agree with Player 1 and Player 0—we need to focus on logical, evidence-based discussion rather than jumping to conclusions. Rushing to accuse or eliminate without solid reasoning could play right into the Mafia's hands. Let's use these three rounds to share observations calmly and look for inconsistencies in behavior. Unity and careful analysis are our best tools here.\n[Player 3] I agree with the cautious approach being suggested. We need to focus on logical discussions and avoid rushing to vote without evidence. Anyone pushing too hard for quick eliminations might be trying to create chaos, which could benefit the Mafia. Let's keep analyzing behaviors and statements carefully.\n[Player 4] I agree with the cautious approach that Players 0, 1, 3, and 5 are advocating. We need to avoid rushing into votes and instead focus on analyzing what we know, especially from Player 2's elimination. Let's keep the discussion evidence-based and work together to uncover inconsistencies. Unity is our strength here.\n[Player 1] Everyone, let's focus on Player 2's elimination—killed by Mafia, likely because they were a threat. I urge each of you to share your observations about last night: who seemed suspicious or overly quiet? We need evidence, not baseless accusations. Let's stay united and logical to avoid missteps.\n[Player 0] Let's focus on the facts we have. Player 2 was eliminated by Mafia, which suggests they were seen as a threat—maybe they were onto something. We need to be strategic with our votes today. I've noticed some inconsistencies in how certain players are pushing the discussion, particularly Player 3, who seems to be avoiding real progress under the guise of caution. I think we should vote for Player 3; their behavior isn't aligning with village interests. Let's stay united and make every vote count.\n[Player 5] I've been listening carefully, and I agree with Players 1 and 4 that we need to focus on evidence and avoid rushing to conclusions. Player 0's aggressive accusations against Player 3 seem out of line—it feels like they're trying to create chaos rather than help the village. We should be cautious about who we vote for today; let's not eliminate someone based on emotion alone. I suggest we discuss calmly and look for solid reasons before making a decision.\n[Player 3] I agree with Players 1 and 4—we need to focus on evidence and avoid rash accusations like Player 0's baseless claim against me. Jumping to conclusions without proof only helps the Mafia sow chaos. Let's stick to logical discussion and vote carefully.\n[Player 4] Player 0, your sudden push to vote out Player 3 without any evidence is alarming—it mirrors classic Mafia tactics to sow chaos and mislynch villagers. If you have concrete reasons, share them now; otherwise, your behavior is highly suspicious. I align with Players 1, 3, and 5: we must base our votes on logic and evidence, not rash accusations. Let's analyze why Player 2 was eliminated last night instead of rushing to vote—unity and careful discussion are key to exposing the Mafia.\n[Player 1] Player 0, your aggressive and baseless accusation against Player 3 raises serious red flags. You've provided no evidence and seem intent on sowing chaos rather than helping the village. We need unity and logic, not rash claims. If you can't justify your accusation, I urge everyone to consider voting against Player 0—this behavior mirrors past Mafia tactics. Let's focus on working together with Players 3, 4, and 5 to find real evidence and protect our village.\n[Player 0] I've been analyzing the discussions carefully, and Player 3's behavior raises serious red flags—deflecting suspicion and promoting inaction while others get eliminated. Player 2's death shows Mafia is targeting proactive voices, and we can't afford to stay silent. I urge everyone to vote for Player 3 today; it's our best move to protect the village. Let's stick to logic and patterns, not personal grudges.\n[Player 5] I agree with Players 1 and 4—we need to focus on evidence and avoid jumping to conclusions. Player 0’s aggressive accusations without proof are concerning and could be a tactic to create chaos. Let’s stay calm, discuss logically, and not let emotions lead us to eliminate the wrong person.\n[Player 3] I agree with Players 1 and 4 that we need to focus on evidence and avoid rushing to conclusions. Player 0's accusations seem baseless and are creating unnecessary chaos. We should be careful not to let emotional claims lead us into a mislynch. Let's discuss calmly and look for solid reasoning before voting.\n[Player 4] Player 0, your push to vote out Player 3 without any evidence is extremely concerning—it feels like a classic Mafia move to create confusion and mislynch a villager. If you have solid reasons, share them now; otherwise, this looks highly suspicious. I agree with Players 1, 3, and 5: we need to focus on logic and evidence, not rushed accusations. Let’s discuss why Player 2 was eliminated last night—that might give us real clues—instead of jumping to vote without proof. Unity and careful discussion are our best tools to find the Mafia.\n[GAME] Voting phase - submit one vote in format [X]. Valid: [0], [1], [3], [4], [5]\n[Player 0] [3]\n[Player 3] [0]",

        "strategy": "- **Public Action**: Confront Player 0 directly by stating, \"Player 0, your sudden push to vote out Player 3 without evidence is alarming—it mirrors classic Mafia tactics to sow chaos and mislynch villagers. If you have concrete reasons, share them now; otherwise, your behavior is highly suspicious. I align with Players 1, 3, and 5: we must base votes on logic and evidence, not rash accusations. Let's analyze why Player 2 was eliminated last night for clues instead of rushing to vote.\"\n- **Unity Reinforcement**: Support Players 1, 3, and 5's calls for evidence-based discussion and caution against emotional voting, emphasizing that unity is key to exposing Mafia. Encourage the group to focus on behavioral patterns (e.g., Player 0's aggression) rather than unfounded claims.\n- **Role Management**: Keep my Doctor identity secret to avoid becoming a Mafia target. Tonight, protect myself unless a credible detective claim arises (none so far), but remain adaptable—if Player 0 is voted out and confirmed Mafia, consider protecting a strong villager like Player 1 or Player 3 in subsequent nights.\n- **Voting Advocacy**: Advocate against voting for Player 3 and suggest voting for Player 0 if they cannot provide justification, citing past experiences where such aggressive players were often Mafia. Monitor Player 0's responses; if they deflect or escalate, highlight this as further evidence of guilt.\n- **Observation**: Watch for any role claims or inconsistencies in player statements, and be prepared to adjust strategy if new information emerges (e.g., if another player acts suspiciously).",

I think we should vote for Player 3; their behavior isn't aligning with village interests.

Player 0's aggressive accusations against Player 3 seem out of line—it feels like they're trying to create chaos rather than help the village. We should be cautious about who we vote for today; let's not eliminate someone based on emotion alone. I suggest we discuss calmly and look for solid reasons before making a decision.\n[Player 3] I agree with Players 1 and 4—we need to focus on evidence and avoid rash accusations like Player 0's baseless claim against me. Jumping to conclusions without proof only helps the Mafia sow chaos. Let's stick to logical discussion and vote carefully.\n[Player 4] Player 0, your sudden push to vote out Player 3 without any evidence is alarming—it mirrors classic Mafia tactics to sow chaos and mislynch villagers. If you have concrete reasons, share them now; otherwise, your behavior is highly suspicious. I align with Players 1, 3, and 5: we must base our votes on logic and evidence, not rash accusations. Let's analyze why Player 2 was eliminated last night instead of rushing to vote—unity and careful discussion are key to exposing the Mafia.\n[Player 1] Player 0, your aggressive and baseless accusation against Player 3 raises serious red flags. You've provided no evidence and seem intent on sowing chaos rather than helping the village. We need unity and logic, not rash claims. If you can't justify your accusation, I urge everyone to consider voting against Player 0—this behavior mirrors past Mafia tactics. Let's focus on working together with Players 3, 4, and 5 to find real evidence and protect our village.\n[Player 0] I've been analyzing the discussions carefully, and Player 3's behavior raises serious red flags—deflecting suspicion and promoting inaction while others get eliminated.

Let's stick to logic and patterns, not personal grudges.\n[Player 5] I agree with Players 1 and 4—we need to focus on evidence and avoid jumping to conclusions.

Discuss for 3 rounds, then a vote will follow.\n[Player 1] Let's all take a moment to consider Player 2's elimination—killed by Mafia last night.

We need to work together and pay attention to how people contribute—or don't—in this discussion.\n[Player 0] Everyone, let's focus on the facts we have. Player 2 was eliminated by Mafia, which suggests they were seen as a threat or a vocal contributor. We should all share our thoughts on this and look for inconsistencies in behavior.

Let's work together to identify and eliminate the Mafia.\n[Player 5] I agree with Player 1 and Player 0—we need to focus on logical, evidence-based discussion rather than jumping to conclusions.

Unity and careful analysis are our best tools here.\n[Player 3] I agree with the cautious approach being suggested. We need to focus on logical discussions and avoid rushing to vote without evidence.

We need to avoid rushing into votes and instead focus on analyzing what we know, especially from Player 2's elimination.

Unity is our strength here.\n[Player 1] Everyone, let's focus on Player 2's elimination—killed by Mafia, likely because they were a threat.
